;
; 0.    Assemble and run this program.
;
; 1.    Observe the output.
;
; 2.    Skim the code. Take a look at the functions and their descriptions.
;       Understand the dependencies between the functions (Which function calls
;       which function), and what is the special purpose of every function.
;
; 3.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand what does it do. 
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can. Add comments if needed.
;
;       Fill in briefly the Output and Operation comments for the way_home
;       function.
;
; 4.    Explain the output. 
;
;       HINTS:
;       -   Add another dummy function to the chain, and compare the result.
;       -   Remove the dummy functions and call the way_home function
;           directly. What do you see? What is the meaning of that output?
