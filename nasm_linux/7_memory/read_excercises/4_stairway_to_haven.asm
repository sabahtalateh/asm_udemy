; 1.    How many inputs does this program accept?
;
; 2.    Try to hand the program different inputs, and observe the different
;       outputs.
;
; 3.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand what does it do. 
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can. Add comments if needed.
;
; 4.    Choose some random inputs and try to predict the output. Verify your
;       predictions by running your program.
;
; 5.    What happens when the input is larger than 0x20 ? Why ?
