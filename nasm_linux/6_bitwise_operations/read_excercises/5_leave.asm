; 1.    How many inputs does this program expect?
;
; 2.    Try to give different inputs to this program, and check the results.
;       Particularly, try the following input pair: (ffffffff,00000000).
;
; 3.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand what does it do. 
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can. Add comments if needed.

; 4.    Pick some random inputs and verify your predictions about what this
